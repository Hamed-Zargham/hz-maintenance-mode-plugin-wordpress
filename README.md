# HZ Maintenance mode Plugin

**HZ Maintenance mode** is a lightweight Wordpress plugin that allows you to put your site into maintenance mode.

A fully customizable maintenance page will be displayed to visitors instead of your site's actual content.

Additionally, the plugin sends a "503 Service Temporarily Unavailable" HTTP status code to visitors' browsers to prevent SEO ranking issues.
